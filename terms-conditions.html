                              provide documents requested for such verification, the Invitee shall not receive the applicable
                              Invitee Bonus specified above due to the Invitee for completing such verification process.<br>
                              &nbsp;<br>
                              <u><strong>Inviter Bonus </strong></u><br>
                              <br>
                              a) In order for an Inviter to be eligible to earn the Bonus Amount due to him/her ("Inviter
                              Bonus"), the Inviter must also download and install the <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> Application on
                              his/her mobile device verify his/her mobile number and email address prior to the completion of
                              the Verification Period.<br>
                              <br>
                              b) The credit of the Inviter Bonus is contingent on the Invitee's participation in cash contests
                              on the Platform. For every Rs. 1 spent by the Invitee to join cash contests on the Platform, the
                              Inviter will be eligible to earn a bonus amount of Rs. 0.10 subject to a maximum of Rs. 50/-. As
                              an example, in the event that the invitee uses Rs. 50 from his Cash Bonus Account or Unutilized
                              Account to join a cash contest or contest through&nbsp;<strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> Application, the
                              Inviter shall be eligible to receive Rs. 5/- as Inviter Bonus upon the successful completion of
                              such contest or contest, provided that the Inviter has successfully completed the requisite steps
                              detailed in a) above that make him/her eligible to receive such amount.<br>
                              <br>
                              c) Subject to the provisions of a) and b) above, the applicable Inviter Bonus earned by the
                              Inviter shall be credited to the Inviter's Cash Bonus Account within fifteen (15) days of the
                              completion of the cash contest or contest in which Invitee has used the Invitee Bonus or within
                              fifteen (15) days of the Inviter completing the relevant step verification process, as the case
                              may be. In the event that the Inviter fails to complete any of the verification steps within the
                              Verification Period or omits to provide documents requested for such verification, the Inviter
                              shall not be eligible to earn the applicable Inviter Bonus.<br>
                              <br>
                              d) It is clarified that the Inviter will be eligible to receive the Inviter Bonus with respect to
                              any contests or contests only in the event the winners are declared for such contests or contests
                              only. In the event that the contest entry amount paid by the Invitee is refunded to the Invitee
                              with respect to any cash contest or contest, for any reason, the Inviter shall not be eligible to
                              receive any Inviter Bonus for such contest or contest.<br>
                              &nbsp;<br>
                              The Bonus Amounts credited to the Inviter/Invitee can be used by the Inviter/Invitee to join cash
                              contests and contests offered by <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> through the Platform. No part of the

                              Bonus Amount may be used to join private contests or be withdrawn or transferred to any other cash
                              balance account held by the Inviter/Invitee with <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> or to any third party
                              account or to any bank/payment instrument account. <u><strong>THE BONUS AMOUNT HAS NO
                              EXPIRY.</strong></u><br>
                              &nbsp;<br>
                              The deposit of the Bonus Amount shall be at the sole discretion of <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> and
                              shall be subject to the Inviter’s/Invitee’s compliance with these Terms.
                              <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> may substitute or change the Bonus Amount offered under the Program at
                              any time without notice. An Inviter/Invitee may not substitute the amount of Bonus Amount or
                              substitute offering for other items or exchange for cash.<br>
                              &nbsp;<br>
                              <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> reserves the right to: withhold the deposit of the Bonus Amount; and/or
                              forfeit any deposited Bonus Amount to an Inviter/Invitee or any prizes/winnings earned by the
                              participant by using such Bonus Amount; and/or deactivate the accounts of the Inviter/Invitee, in
                              the event that it determines or reasonably believes that such Inviter/Invitee has violated these
                              Terms or the terms and conditions of the <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> fantasy contest. Mere
                              participation in the Program does not entitle the Inviter/Invitee to receive any Bonus Amount.<br>
                              &nbsp;<br>
                              <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> may, at its sole and absolute discretion, disqualify any
                              Inviter/Invitee if such Inviter/Invitee engages in or it is found that such Inviter/Invitee has
                              engaged in any illegal, unlawful or improper conduct (with regard to the Program or otherwise).
                              The decision of <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> will be final and binding with regard to the Program,
                              and the deposit of the Bonus Amount and no correspondence, objection, complaints, etc. will be
                              entertained in this regard.<br>
                              &nbsp;<br>
                              This Program cannot be clubbed with any other contests/promotions/programs that are running
                              simultaneously and organized or conducted by <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong>.<br>
                              &nbsp;<br>
                              <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> reserves the right to change/modify/or withdraw the Program and/or
                              change these terms and conditions without any prior notice of the same at its sole discretion. The
                              Terms and Conditions, as applicable to the <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong>'s fantasy contest and
                              services, will apply to and govern the Program.&nbsp;<strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> does not make any
                              commitment, express or implied, to respond to any feedback, suggestion and, or, queries of the

                              aggregate liability of <strong><b>MEGASCORES</b></strong> to a participating Inviter/Invitee in relation
                              to the Program for any reason whatsoever shall not exceed Rs.50.<br>
                              <br>
